## 🔧 Technical Specifications

### Sync Types & Schedules
| Data Type | Frequency | Method | Priority |
|-----------|-----------|---------|----------|
| Orders | Daily 2AM | Incremental (7 days) | High |
| Catalog Items | Daily 2AM | Full sync | High |
| Categories | Daily 2AM | Full sync | Medium |
| Locations | Daily 2AM | Full sync | Low |
| Inventory | Daily 2AM | Incremental (24h) | Medium |

## 📊 Current Status

### ✅ Completed
- [x] **Historical Data Recovery**: All 30,391 orders now in production
- [x] **Root Cause Analysis**: Identified web app transaction issues
- [x] **Proof of Concept**: Direct sync approach validated
- [x] **Emergency Script**: `direct_orders_sync.py` working perfectly

### ✅ Completed
- [x] **Historical Data Recovery**: All 30,391 orders now in production
- [x] **Sync Engine Service**: Successfully tested with 26,286 orders
- [x] **Sync Orchestrator Script**: CLI interface working
- [x] **Notification System**: Email alerts for failures and success reports

### 🔄 Next Steps
1. ✅ ~~Implement `sync_engine.py` service~~
2. ✅ ~~Build sync orchestrator script~~
3. ✅ ~~Implement notification system~~
4. Begin Phase 2: Web Integration
5. Test complete sync workflow in development environment

## 🚨 Critical Notes

### Emergency Procedures
- **Emergency Script**: `direct_orders_sync.py` can recover missing orders
- **Database Access**: Use Cloud SQL Proxy for direct production access
- **Backup Plan**: Manual sync via direct scripts if web interface fails

### Known Issues
- **Web App Transactions**: Current async transaction handling is unreliable
- **Separate Sync Processes**: Orders and catalog sync separately (needs unification)
- **No Failure Alerts**: Currently no notification when syncs fail

### Success Metrics
- **Zero Failed Syncs**: Daily syncs must complete successfully
- **Fast Recovery**: Manual syncs complete within 5 minutes
- **Immediate Alerts**: Failures detected and reported within 15 minutes
- **Complete Coverage**: All data types synced daily

## 🎯 June 24 Readiness Checklist
- [ ] Daily syncs running reliably
- [ ] Failure notifications working
- [ ] Manual sync capability tested
- [ ] Emergency procedures documented
- [ ] Performance monitoring in place
- [ ] Rollback procedures tested
